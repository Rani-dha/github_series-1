####Git & GitHub
    Git is free and open source Distributed Version Control System (DVCS), i.e) It's a tool that help all the techies to do team development perfectly and smoothly. It runs in command line interface.
GitHub is also a free and open source platform. It provides a web - based graphical interface. Mainly it provides Access Control and Collabration features for every programmers.

#####Popularity:
* It's support all the popular programming languages and streamlines the iteration process.
* Hosts various source code projects of all techies.
* Easy Version Control
* Secure cloud storage
* Free open source
   
Git workflow works:
    *It premits every Programmer and Developer to clones the repositor, works locally on the codes,makes a commit with changes, and push it to the central repository for others to pull and continue their work.
    *There are three stages:
       </> Committed: It is stored in Local repository with all the  changes.
       </> Modified  : It contains changes to the files but none of the changes are being saved to the local repository.
       </> Staged : Files is in index(stage) i.e) It is tagged to be considered  in the next commit.

Different stages of a git project as commit, add:
     Initializing Git - git init
     Adding files to share - git add filename
     Saving the added files - git commit -m "The short message"
     Adding a remote Repository - git remote add nickname link_of_Githubrepo
     Uploading files - git push nickname master 

Fork - Allows us to create a copy of the original repository and stores in our GitHub .
Clone - After forking, Cloning is used to make a copy from the GitHub to our local repository i.e) Git. Allowing us to make changes.
Branch - It is used when working in projects as teams. A Repository can have one or more branches. The Default Branch is master. It is used for separating  some parts of code from the master branch. After the changes are made, we can also able to merge the new branch with master branch.

Pull Request - It lets us tell others about the changes that we have pushed to an original repository from which we have forked, cloned earlier. Requesting and Explaining the owner of the repository about the changes that we made.
Merge Conflicts - It is a process that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.when two developers are working on the same file and making the changes on the same file, merge conflict occurs.
Issues - A command-line tool that makes git easier to use with GitHub. To track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub.
