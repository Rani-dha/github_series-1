   GIT:
    * Git is free and open source Distributed Version Control System (DVCS), i.e) It's a tool that help all the techies to do team development perfectly and smoothly. It runs in command line interface.
   GITHUB:
    * GitHub is also a free and open source platform. It provides a web - based graphical interface. Mainly it provides Access Control and Collabration features for every programmers.

2. Why GitHub is so popular and used in most of the projects?
    </> It's support all the popular programming languages and streamlines the iteration process.
    </> Hosts various source code projects of all techies.
    </>  Easy Version Control
    </>  Secure cloud storage
    </>  Free open source
   
3. What is version control system ? How Git is a VCS?
     * A Version Control System records the changes that we make to all project files. It provides clarity when reviewing software by describing When, What, Why it was changed!
     * It keeps tracking changes of source code in software development of all programmers and developers. Hence Git is known as VCS.

4. What are the other platforms similar to Github?
    </> GitKraken
    </> Gitlab
    </> BitBucket
    </> Source Forge
    </> AWS CodeCommit
    </> Beanstalk
    </> Gitea
    </>  Apache Allura

5. Why are you interested in learning of Git and Github?
   Interests that make me to learn it:
    </> To begin my projects and open source contribution.
    </> Whenever I open a LinkedIn, every senior programmers and developers includes the Github 
Repository Link in most of their posts, which makes me curious to learn about it!


Git and GitHub Series: Task-2

Link to the GitHub repository .

Link to the GitHub Readme.md

1. How git workflow works?
    *It premits every Programmer and Developer to clones the repositor, works locally on the codes,makes a commit with changes, and push it to the central repository for others to pull and continue their work.
    *There are three stages:
       </> Committed: It is stored in Local repository with all the  changes.
       </> Modified  : It contains changes to the files but none of the changes are being saved to the local repository.
       </> Staged : Files is in index(stage) i.e) It is tagged to be considered  in the next commit.

2.What're the different stages of a git project as commit, add?
    </> Initializing Git - git init
    </> Adding files to share - git add filename
    </> Saving the added files - git commit -m "The short message"
    </> Adding a remote Repository - git remote add nickname link_of_Githubrepo
    </> Uploading files - git push nickname master 

3. Is it possible to do a git commit before git add. if you have made any changes? Explain  why?
    * No, it is not possible. we can't commit without a git add because we should add the different versions and then commit it to view the changes.

4. Why is git diff used?
    * It is used to find the difference between the versions.

5. Can we leave the commit messages as blank?
    * Yes, we can leave the messages as blank. By using, git commit -a --allow-empty-message-m'' 
    * A Good practice is to commit messages for better understanding.
